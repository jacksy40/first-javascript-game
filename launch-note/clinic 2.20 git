Git

useful things about GIT
  -version control
  -rollback ( happens all the time when I add code and ends up breaking everything)
  -commit more often more place in time to go back to the code where it worked
  -colaboration(open source projects)
  -segmentation and experimentation branch out from the first feature and branch out to experiement
  then if want to change by merging the branch

{example of changes-
  state 1 of
  math.rb
  def add(a,b)
  a+b
  end

  state 2 of
  math.rb
  def add(a,b)
  a+b
  end
  def sub(a,b)
  a-b
  end
}
how GIT makes a commit

-unstaged changes
    .rb files => stage(picture open box) use (git add -A)command to add the files to the box
    stagged files => commit(git commit)(box closes and ready to push to server for backup)

    in the stagged state use
    git diff --staged
    check satus (git s)- to see where your files are
    avoid (reset --hard)

briefly talk about psql
-make sure we have it for next week
next week database
