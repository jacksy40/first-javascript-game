	Indicies 
	*Understand how indicies work
		How to use
		how db searches
		how db stores data
		when indexes are used
	
		Index 
			addition column added to a table to speed up search 
				-like a index in a library( helps you go directly to the record or approximately where it 				 				is )				
				- 
				
				student_id_index has two parts
				
				id      &
				value point
				
				common to index the foreign key
				create index cohort_id_student_index on students (cohort_id)
				(another way)
				create table students (
				id int primary,
				name string
				);
				
				when table is indexed it can query through a balance tree
				to store a ordered list of data 
				DB uses a doubley linked list 
				logically sequential 
				does not need to be physically squential
				works like a chain 
				example
				store row one  
				store row two 
				row one points to row two and two points to three and so on. If doesnt matter if row 15 gets inserted in between 4 and 5 
				what does a balance search tree looks like?
				trees never get deeper than 6 levels
				algorithmic math
				equation to determine if an indicies would even be used
				selectivity = cardinality/number of records * 100%
				what is cardinality
				what is selectivity ( chance the record is unique serial primary key has a selectivity of 100 vs boolean is very low )
				
										123
										
				123		        		123						123		
								
		123		123		123		123		123		123		123		123		123
		
		What to index
				long unique column for a index to be useful
