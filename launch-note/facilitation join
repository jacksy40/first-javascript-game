facilitation SQL join

	Inner joins or just (join) default 
		select * from a join b on a.name = b.name
		ven diagram A and b cirlces the join is what A and B both holds 
		that creates a new table or think of it as a (report)
	
	Full outer joins
		select * from A full outer join b on a.name = b.name
		ven dagram  and b will show everything 
		full outer join will take *everything including null* from both tables we are joining and make it in one. 
	
	Left/Right Outer Join
	  Left	
		select * from A left outer join B on a.name=b.name
		ven diagram all of everything in A and include what elements
		 B shares with A 
	  Right		
		select * from A right outer join B on a.name=b.name
		ven diagram all of everything in B and include what elements
		 B shares with A
	
	Left/Right Outer join (where/nil)
	  Left
		select * from A left outer join B on a.name=b.name
		ven diagram all of everything in A and exclude what elements
	 	B shares with A
	 Right
 		select * from A right outer join B on a.name=b.name
 		ven diagram all of everything in B and exclude what elements
 	 	B shares with A
	
	full Outer Join (where nil)
	
	excludes from showing any relation A and B holds. 
	
	cross join 
	select * from A cross join B
	?? creates a matrix-y
	
	how to re-qeury the join table 
	use where statement set contions of what shows up on your new table 
	(think about report writer and the reports produced at bnymellon. We used an interface to query the database. Selecting what you want to show up on your report or select predefined report )
	
	Why more than one table
	
	when do you use SQL and when do you want to use active record query generation language?
