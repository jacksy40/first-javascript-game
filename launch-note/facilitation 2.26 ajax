				ruby hash to json object 
				ruby array to  json object with array
				.to_jason monkey patch(term)-add methods to make it behave a different way
				ruby hash after .to_json the methods are added and turns it into a json
				in the body on strings can be displayed
				client side using jquery it reconstructs by parsing the string into a JSON
				content type gives client a hint what kind of information is coming
				old implementation of old ajax code
				jquery builds all the code that makes all browser and codes work together
				always use jquery
				DOM manipulator
