using songs database as and example
	flat table db 
	how to normalize it goal is to have no duplication(change things in one place)
		reduece redundancy but downside is more complex sql query
		look for duplication
		create a two table db
		
		songs Data
		id (pk)
		artist_id (fk)
		track 
		title
		
		Artists Data
		id 
		name
		
		albums Data
		id
		name
		image
		
		How do you organize data 
		
		many singles has one artists and one 
		one to many 
		rarely many to many (join table)
		
		artists id 					join table							songs id 
		
		more than one artist		artist id 								title 
									songs id 
									1 , 5	
									2 , 5
